### Using Python to create a predicitive model of Global CO2 Emissions

### Notice:
- DATA WAS DOWNLOADED FROM KAGGLE
- Link to source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imtkaggleteam/co-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions

## Learnings: 
- Learned how to properly pull data into the program and use python libraries such as Plot to help visualize that data
- Developed a process for troubleshooting errors read code -> look over/analyze code for errors -> check to make sure terminal and changes are saved -> utilize chatGPT to aid in the understanding of specific error to efficiently move through the roadblock
- Learned how the Plot, numpy, pandas, seaborn and matPlotLib libraries to visualization and analyze data
